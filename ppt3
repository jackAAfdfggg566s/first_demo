Hereâ€™s a structured overview of AWS FIS targets and actions for your presentation:

Slide 1: Introduction to AWS FIS Targets and Actions
Overview: AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) allows users to create controlled experiments that inject faults into their applications to test resilience.
Slide 2: FIS Targets
Definition: Targets are the resources on which the fault injection actions will be applied.
Types of Targets:
EC2 Instances: Inject failures or delays in virtual machines.
ECS Tasks: Test containerized applications by simulating task failures.
EKS Pods: Evaluate Kubernetes applications by injecting faults at the pod level.
API Gateway: Simulate API call failures or latency.
Custom Targets: Define specific resources using tags or resource IDs.
Slide 3: FIS Actions
Definition: Actions are the specific faults that you can inject into the targets.
Types of Actions:
Terminate: Stop or terminate EC2 instances or ECS tasks.
Delay: Introduce artificial latency in network calls.
Throttle: Limit the bandwidth of API Gateway requests.
Reboot: Restart EC2 instances to test recovery processes.
Network Disruption: Simulate network issues like packet loss or DNS failures.
Slide 4: Combining Targets and Actions
Experiment Design: Users can define experiments by selecting specific targets and corresponding actions.
Example Scenario:
Target: EC2 Instance
Action: Introduce a 10-second delay on network requests.
Goal: Assess how the application behaves under simulated network latency.
Slide 5: Monitoring and Analysis
Real-Time Monitoring: Use AWS CloudWatch to observe metrics during experiments.
Post-Experiment Analysis: Evaluate the impact of injected faults on application performance and stability.
Slide 6: Conclusion
Benefits of Targets and Actions: Allows for comprehensive testing of application resilience and helps teams identify weaknesses and improve reliability.
