Slide 2: Introduction to AWS FIS
What is AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)?
A service designed to help developers and operations teams create and run fault injection experiments.
Goal: Test application resilience and availability, identifying potential issues.
Slide 3: Key Features
Fault Injection: Simulate various failure scenarios (e.g., network latency, instance termination).
Safety: Conduct tests in a safe environment without impacting production.
Visualization: Intuitive tools for experiment design and result analysis.
Slide 4: Types of Faults
Instance Failures: Terminate or restart EC2 instances.
Network Failures: Introduce latency, packet loss, or bandwidth restrictions.
Resource Constraints: Limit CPU, memory, or I/O.
Service Disruptions: Simulate AWS service outages.
Slide 5: How It Works
Create an Experiment: Define the type of faults to inject and the affected resources.
Run the Experiment: Execute the experiment as planned.
Monitor Results: Observe application behavior and performance metrics.
Analyze Data: Evaluate system resilience and recovery capabilities.
Slide 6: Use Cases
Testing Application Resilience: Ensure systems operate correctly under failure conditions.
Optimizing Recovery Procedures: Validate and enhance disaster recovery plans.
Training Teams: Help teams understand and respond to failures.
Slide 7: Integration and Compatibility
Integrates with other AWS services (e.g., CloudWatch, CloudTrail).
Supports AWS SDK and CLI for automation of experiments.
Slide 8: Real-World Case Study
Case Study: How a company used FIS to discover and resolve potential service issues.
Summary of experiment results and improvement measures taken.
Slide 9: Conclusion
AWS FIS is a powerful tool for enhancing application resilience.
Fault injection allows teams to better identify and resolve issues.
Slide 10: Q&A
Open the floor for questions.
Encourage discussion and sharing of experiences.
