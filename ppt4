Sure! Here’s the revised Slide 4 focusing on the EC2 Terminate example:

Slide 4: Combining Targets and Actions
Experiment Design: Users can define experiments by selecting specific targets and corresponding actions.
Example Scenario:
Target: EC2 Instance
Action: Terminate the instance.
Goal: Assess the application’s behavior and recovery mechanisms when an EC2 instance is abruptly terminated.
Slide 5: Monitoring and Analysis
Real-Time Monitoring: Use AWS CloudWatch to observe metrics during experiments.
Post-Experiment Analysis: Evaluate the impact of the instance termination on application performance and stability.
